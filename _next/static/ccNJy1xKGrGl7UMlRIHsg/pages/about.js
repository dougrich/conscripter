Ideally, a custom font makes this easy to work with.\n\nUnfortunately, creating a custom font is a significant undertaking, especially if your language does not directly map onto the latin alphabet. Consider trying to make a logogram like Egyptian Hieroglyphs, a syllabary like Japanese, or an alphasyllabary like Hangul. Not every conlang warrants a block of unicode like J R R Tolkien's Tengwar.\n\nConscripter is intended to simplify that process. Upload your glyph as an SVG and specify what text it replaces. Download font.\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nAnybody trying to make a font for their conlang that they can use in tools like Word, Illustrator, Photoshop, their website, or Inkscape.\n\n### Who is this not for?\n\nAre you a hardcore typography nerd who fully understands contextual alternates, chaining, and how the substitution stuff works?\n\nThis tool is probably too limited for you - you might get more mileage from something like Font Forge, an excellent tool that I used to check my work here.\n\nAdditionally, I'd really appreciate any feedback you can give on the end result or pointers on how to improve this app to be more useful.",s=o("tG9k"),l=i.a.createElement;function u(t){return Object(e.a)(t),l(s.a,{title:"About",source:r})}},rB5V:function(t,n,o){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/about",function(){return o("Juyh")}])}},[["rB5V",1,2,0,3,5,4]]]);
